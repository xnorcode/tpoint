# tPoint Android app
tPoint is an ongoing Android app project which helps users tag locations that want other users to be warned about in a multichannel realm.
#### Example use case
You might want to tag all mobile traffic control cameras in your daily route so that other users in the same channel get warned about them as they are getting closer to the point with a simple alarm.
Each user can check and validate the point as they pass nearby and can remove it from the app if is not valid anymore.
